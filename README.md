# status-posting-system
 For my coursework, I created a Status Posting Platform utilizing HTML/CSS to design an intuitive and responsive web interface, PHP for backend functionality, and MySQL for database integration. The aim of this project is to offer a user-friendly platform where users can effortlessly share and search for updates and statuses.

 ## Technologies Used:
- HTML: Language used for structuring the webpage.
- CSS: Used for styling the webpage.
- PHP: Backend language used to manage all processes.
- MySQL: Utilized for storing statuses and all relevant information.

 ## How to use the application:
- Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/rafaelmarcoo/status-posting-system`
- Open XAMPP and start Apache and MySQL
- In phpMyAdmin, create a database named 'status_posting_system'
- Run index.html using XAMPP on local machine.

### Homepage:
This is the primary homepage of the website. Here, you can find buttons to post a status, search statuses, and learn more about the project. Sensitive information has been omitted and substituted with asterisks.

### Posting a status:
This page includes the form for posting a status along with the relevant fields. It also incorporates validation to ensure input validity, preventing the use of duplicate status codes and ensuring that statuses are not just whitespaces.

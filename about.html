            <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>What special features have you done or attempted in creating the website?</li>
                <p> - I made a simple, intuitive user interface for this website coursework. I housed the links so they look like buttons to keep it uniform with the rest of the website. </p>
                <p> - I used a lot of CSS to make the website nice and intuitive.</p>

                <li>Which part(s) did you have trouble with?</li>
                <p> - I had troubles with poststatusprocess.php where I was initialising variables from user input. It was for permission. I wanted it to initialise even with multi-valued permission inputs. But by looking through past lecture slides and reading through different forums online I was able to solve it. It also involved altering poststatusform.php as well.</p>
                <p> - I also had a couple of problems making regular expressions for checking input validity. It took a lot of trial and error.</p>
                <p>- It also took trial and error to find out which method was the most efficient way of checking validity. This involved trying SQL statements, experimenting with loops, etc.</p>

                <li>What would you like to do better next time?</li>
                <p> - I would probably make the user interface better next time I make a website, and would involve animation, etc.</p>
                <p> - I would learn more through the slides, as most of the vital information like functions that I needed were in the lecture slides. So lesson for me is to go through them thoroughly.</p>

                <li>What you have learnt along the way? Did you use any references or resources during this project? If so, please include the sources.</li>
                <p> - I learned a lot making this website. It reinforced everything I have learned regarding HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL. It was very good revision and getting good experience with these languages. This was really fun to make.</p>
                <p> - I used heaps of from online resources in order to create this website: </p>
